# Why do we code?

because if you want to bake an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.

---

# No, but really?

* For Work
* To Learn
* For Fun

---

# Coding to Learn

* Reverse Engineering
* Writing a Hello World
	* Going a little deeper

---

# Coding for Fun

* Coding for the sake of building things
* Just to push our own boundaries
* And the boundaries of the world around us

---

## I didn't have control over much as a kid. But I had control over RPG Maker.

^ code as a means of escapism

---

# The inter-relation

Coding for work keeps us paid so that we can build our communities for fun
(Otherwise OSS as we know it wouldn't exist.)

---

# Side Projects

These are our fun coding projects-- "no real business value"

---

# Or is that true?

* Preventing burnout
* Bringing in new people
* Encouraging curiosity

^ And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. 
They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. 
I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.

---

## Our very species needs these side projects, be they code or otherwise, to continue to thrive

^ Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations. The Cosmos is rich beyond measure— in elegant facts, in exquisite interrelationships, in the subtle machinery of awe.

---

# [fit] But why code?

---

Code allows us to begin from almost nothing. We can take a small, cheap computer, and build an apple pie (or an entire cosmos) from scratch.

^ One could say you can use a raspberry pi to create an apple pie.
^ Eratosthenes’ only tools were sticks, eyes, feet and brains, plus a taste for experiment. With them he deduced the circumference of the Earth with an error of only a few percent, a remarkable achievement for 2,200 years ago. He was the first person accurately to measure the size of a planet.

# an aside on tropes

* you do not have to code for fun to be a good programmer. 
* you are allowed to have other interests
* and no, those don't have to include star wars
* For instance, I like baseball and woodworking!

# Robotics

---

We're moving in the same direction here. Cheaper boards, less to start, more to gain.

^ Cambrian explosion of NodeBots
Johnny-five has 35+ platforms
tessel, kinoma, espruino

---

We're doing really cool things with NodeBots 

![inline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5grMgbhSW4)

---

### And the NodeBots community, while not perfect, is diverse, respectful, and welcoming

---

## [fit] Why?

---

More important than the code, and the robots, are the **people**.

---

And, unfortunately, that's what has me **the most optimistic** and yet **the most cynical**.

# Cynicism: The Library at Alexandria

^ For centuries, they supported research and maintained in the library a working environment for the best minds of the age. It contained ten large research halls, each devoted to a separate subject; fountains and colonnades; botanical gardens; a zoo; dissecting rooms; an observatory; and a great dining hall where, at leisure, was conducted the critical discussion of ideas. The heart of the library was its collection of books. The organizers combed all the cultures and languages of the world. They sent agents abroad to buy up libraries. Commercial ships docking in Alexandria were searched by the police— not for contraband, but for books. The scrolls were borrowed, copied and then returned to their owners. Accurate numbers are difficult to estimate, but it seems probable that the Library contained half a million volumes, each a handwritten papyrus scroll.

---

## we have the library, but we are lacking in our passion to fill it.

^ via excluding others, and allowing those who patronize our communities to arbitrarily filter people out

---

## we are, in fact, distrubingly close to the fate of the Library at Alexandria

^ What happened to all those books? The classical civilization that created them disintegrated, and the library itself was deliberately destroyed. Only a small fraction of its works survived, along with a few pathetic scattered fragments. And how tantalizing those bits and pieces are! We know, for example, that there was on the library shelves a book by the astronomer Aristarchus of Samos, who argued that the Earth is one of the planets, which like them orbits the Sun, and that the stars are enormously far away. Each of these conclusions is entirely correct, but we had to wait nearly two thousand years for their rediscovery. If we multiply by a hundred thousand our sense of loss for this work of Aristarchus, we begin to appreciate the grandeur of the achievement of classical civilization and the tragedy of its destruction.

# A few notes on privilege

* Priviliege is a spectrum, not a binary.
* You are allowed to be upset over how you are treated, even if someone else has it worse.
* You, as a victim, do not have to remain silent. And you are not alone.

---

# Codes of Conduct and the Library

* We create rules in our communities to allow people in
* We all make mistakes-- this is not about exile and shame, but about education and reform
* We only remove unrepentant and repeated infringers
* We need these rules because we do not all act like adults. And even when we do, we will slip up.

---

## We are not an angry mob. We are simply asking for a framework to ensure equal respect and treament of all.

---

# The Resistance to Codes of Conduct

* If we lived in perfect world, we wouldn't need these
	* we also wouldn't need laws against murder and theft!
* I find the most resistance comes from **the very people that don't need its protection**

^ "Society corrupts the best of us. It is a little unfair, I think, to criticize a person for not sharing the enlightenment of a later epoch, but it is also profoundly saddening that such prejudices were so extremely pervasive. The question raises nagging uncertainties about which of the conventional truths of our own age will be considered unforgivable bigotry by the next."

---

# "You should judge [code or] hardware, not people"

The intent is not to pass judgement on those who infringe, but to ensure that all attendees of an event, or participants of a community, are treated with dignity, fairness, and respect.

---

# "You can't just exile people you don't like"

Codes of conduct are about education, not exile. No one is perfect (including and especially myself), and this is recognized.

---

# "You don't win allies by shouting/being angry"

* Yes, well, sitting by and doing nothing didn't really work, did it?
* without confronting predjudice, it will continue unabated

^ Prejudice literally means pre-judgement, the rejection of a contention out of hand, before examining the evidence. Predjudice is the result of powerful emotions, not of sound reasoning.

---

# The allegory between ancient science and today's communities

* The problem then was that the rules prevented the study and spread of ideas
* Today, the lack of a rule system allows the oppression created by that former system to prevent the study and spread of ideas

---

# Optimism: Ionia

^ With many different islands, there was a variety of political systems. No single concentration of power could enforce social and intellectual conformity in all the islands. Free inquiry became possible. The promotion of superstition was not considered a political necessity. Unlike many other cultures, the Ionians were at the crossroads of civilizations, not at one of the centers. In Ionia, the Phoenician alphabet was first adapted to Greek usage and widespread literacy became possible. Writing was no longer a monopoly of the priests and scribes. The thoughts of many were available for consideration and debate.
^ It was in the Eastern Mediterranean that African, Asian, and European civilizations, including the great cultures of Egypt and Mesopotamia, met and cross-fertilized in a vigorous and heady confrontation of prejudices, languages, ideas and gods.

---

# A note on destroying your idols

We let way too many people get away with bad behavior because they wrote a library, or give sound technical advice. We need to start objectively viewing the behavior of a person with their technical output.

^ What do you do when you are faced with several different gods each claiming the same territory? The Babylonian Marduk and the Greek Zeus was each considered master of the sky and king of the gods. You might decide that Marduk and Zeus were really the same. You might also decide, since they had quite different attributes, that one of them was merely invented by the priests. But if one, why not both?
And so it was that the great idea arose, the realization that there might be a way to know the world without the god hypothesis; that there might be principles, forces, laws of nature, through which the world could be understood without attributing the fall of every sparrow to the direct intervention of Zeus.

---

# We are also, at our best, a global version of Ionia

Information is freely available, and besides the pessism of how we treat each other, we are getting code, robotics in to the hands of more people than ever.

---

### But we must work much harder to prevent destruction-- like we currently do to spread information

---

# but, Kas...

^ Here's all the excuses I hear. A lot. Every week or so.

---

## "But I haven't seen this happen, so it must be ok!"

^ In many such cases we are not unbiased observers. We have an emotional stake in the outcome-- perhaps merely because the borderline belief system, if true, makes the world a more interesting place; but perhaps there is something there that strikes more deeply into the human psyche"

---

## "But \[this person/company who messed up\] does so many good things!

^ After Sagan's failed prophetic dream: "After my experience I did not write a letter...relating a compelling predictive dream which was not borne out of reality. That is not a memorable letter...The hits are recorded, the misses are not."

---

## Everything is NOT great, "meritocracy" is still a myth, and telling yourself any different is deterimental.

^ "If we believe that benign extraterestrials will solve our problems, we may tempted to exert less than our full measure of effort to solve them ourselves."

---

# My Ultimatum

We do not need horrible people that happen to write good code in our communities. **if we support everyone, and become Ionia presiding over Alexandria, the good code will follow.**

---

# The spark of Hope: Johannes Kepler

* created the laws of planetary motion and began to discover the fundamental underpinnings of gravity
* Was a light of sharing knowledge as nepotism and fear began to destroy scientific progress

^ "Science is based on experiment, on a willingness to challenge old dogma, on an openness to see the universe as it really is. Accordingly, science sometimes requires courage— at the very least the courage to question the conventional wisdom. "

---

# [fit] you, too, can be a Kepler.

^ If you see something, say something

^ Every cell of your body is a kind of commune, with once free-living parts all banded together for the common good. And you are made of a hundred trillion cells. We are, each of us, a multitude.

---

# What to do if you're called on your BS

* Listen
* Learn
* Remember: It's critcism of your actions, not your character

^ "People are rarely grateful for a demonstration of their credulity"

---

## How else can I, a privilged person, help?

"One of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences" -- Anita Sarkeesian

That, except extended to **everyone from any marginalized group**, ESPECIALLY if someone is confiding in you something that happened to them

^ There seems to be a stage, shortly after an eyewitness event, in which we verbalize what we think we have seen and then forever after lock it into our memories. We are very velnerable in that stage, and any prevailing beliefs...can unconciously influence our eyewitness account

---

## Also, please stop asking or saying the following:

* Is it really that bad?
* I've never seen anything like that!
* But tech's one of the better industries, right?!

---

# a final thought

^  I am, reluctantly, a self-confessed carbon chauvinist. Carbon is abundant in the Cosmos. It makes marvelously complex molecules, good for life. I am also a water chauvinist. Water makes an ideal solvent system for organic chemistry to work in and stays liquid over a wide range of temperatures. But sometimes I wonder. Could my fondness for materials have something to do with the fact that I am made chiefly of them? Are we carbon-and water-based because those materials were abundant on the Earth at the time of the origin of life? Could life elsewhere—on Mars, say—be built of different stuff? I am a collection of water, calcium and organic molecules called Carl Sagan. You are a collection of almost identical molecules with a different collective label. But is that all? Is there nothing in here but molecules? Some people find this idea somehow demeaning to human dignity. For myself, I find it elevating that our universe permits the evolution of molecular machines as intricate and subtle as we.

^ But the essence of life is not so much the atoms and simple molecules that make us up as the way in which they are put together. Every now and then we read that the chemicals which constitute the human body cost ninety-seven cents or ten dollars or some such figure; it is a little depressing to find our bodies valued so little. However, these estimates are for human beings reduced to our simplest possible components. We are made mostly of water, which costs almost nothing; the carbon is costed in the form of coal; the calcium in our bones as chalk; the nitrogen in our proteins as air (cheap also); the iron in our blood as rusty nails. If we did not know better, we might be tempted to take all the atoms that make us up, mix them together in a big container and stir. We can do this as much as we want. But in the end all we have is a tedious mixture of atoms. How could we have expected anything else?

^ Harold Morowitz has calculated what it would cost to put together the correct molecular constituents that make up a human being by buying the molecules from chemical supply houses. The answer turns out to be about ten million dollars, which should make us all feel a little better. But even then we could not mix those chemicals together and have a human being emerge from the jar. That is far beyond our capability and will probably be so for a very long period of time. Fortunately, there are other less expensive but still highly reliable methods of making human beings.
